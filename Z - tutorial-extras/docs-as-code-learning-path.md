# Docs-as-Code

This approach treats documentation like software development, using tools such as version control systems (e.g., Git), markup languages (e.g., Markdown, AsciiDoc), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Docs-as-code enables collaboration, streamlines workflows, and ensures documentation is always up-to-date with product changes. It also supports automation, making it easier to publish content across multiple formats and platforms. This trend aligns documentation processes with Agile and DevOps practices, fostering faster, more efficient, and scalable content creation.
